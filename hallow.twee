When you enter through the front door the first thing you see is red glowing light. You hear 2 different whispers. The first one says "Come closer and touch the order". The second one says "RUN AWAY NOW WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!!!". The second one starts to slowly get louder. Do you listen to the first voice and touch the light? Do you listen to the second voice and run away? Or would you like to think for a second?
